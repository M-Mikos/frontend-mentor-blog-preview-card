## What have I learned

I've practised semantic HTML with tags such as `<date>` or `<figure>`. I also gained greater understanding of CSS resetting and normalization.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Reset boilerplate code
- CSS Normalise boilerplate code
- [SASS preprocessor](https://sass-lang.com/)
- BEM architecture
- Elements of 7-1 SASS architecture
